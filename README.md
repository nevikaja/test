# Test Repository

This repository contains a simple example website with a comment form.

The site is located in the `website` directory and can be opened directly in a browser. It collects a user's first name, last name, age, gender, country, and comment, then displays the submitted comments below the form.

### Deployment

To make the site publicly accessible, host the contents of the `website` directory on any static hosting provider such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Simply upload the files and point your domain to the deployed site.
